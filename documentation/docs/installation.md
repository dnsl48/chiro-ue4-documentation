## Configuration

There are 2 configuration options. They enable extra features not needed for most of the usual workflows.

 - Advanced features (disabled). This option makes some advanced tools to appear in UI. Most of those are used internally by other tools and are not required for straightforward use.

 - Developer mode (disabled). This option makes a developer UI panel to show up. The panel comprises tools only needed for developers of this addon and not required for any usual workflows.
